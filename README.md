# hello-world-gadget

To edit with Codio, click Tools -> Terminal and type these commands:

    cd hello-world-gadget-master
    bower install
    versal preview

Then click "Project index" dropdown (it is so-called "Preview" button in Codio) set "New tab" and choose "Box URL".

Versal SDK should open in new tab.

To upload, use terminal:

    versal signin
    versal upload

## To be done

1. Flatten directory so you won't need to type `cd hello-world-gadget-master`.
2. Set up .codio file to expose "Run" and "Preview" in toolbar. You won't need to type commands anymore.
3. Communicate sessionId if open by signed in account.

Enjoy!
